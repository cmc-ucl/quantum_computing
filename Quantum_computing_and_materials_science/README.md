# Quantum computing and materials science: A practical guide to applying quantum annealing to the configurational analysis of materials

This repository contains the functions and data needed to reproduce the results reported in (ADD REFERENCE).

The data_analysis Jupyter Notebook is divided in sections following the structure of the paper.

The user has the option to run the quantum annealing by using the "Run the anneal cell" or load data saved in the data folder by using the "Load saved dataframe" cells. For the former option, an account on <a href='https://www.dwavesys.com/solutions-and-products/cloud-platform/'>Leap</a> is required. Please follow the instructions at this <a href='https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/signup/'>link</a> to get access.
